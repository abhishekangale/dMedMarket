dMedMarket provides a secure marketplace for verified medical research and EMR data.

Health research while necessary, is inefficient and costly. Why? In part, bc public datasets are not aggregated and key terms aren’t easily searchable. As much as 85% of medical research is redundant, costing us near $200 billion a year.

The only way to get a specific dataset from a scientist is to personally ask, which researchers are often reluctant to do—unless you’re a colleague, b/c it’s risky and they aren’t being compensated.

The privacy and security of health data poses a large ethical concern. Studies show that more than 80% of consumers are willing to share their health data for research—but it must be private and secure.

Lastly patients have had little control over their health information. In research participants are paid for their data, but are then divorced from any future use of that data.

Enter dMedMarket.

dMedMarket offers a novel ethereum-based solution with a react front end. After receiving the participant’s consent, the researcher uploads the participant’s health data onto the blockchain as an electronic health record. Within the application, other researchers can obtain this raw de-identified data by paying the source researcher and participant a nominal fee.ers can obtain this raw de-identified data by paying the source researcher and participant a nominal fee.
